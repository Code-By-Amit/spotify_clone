### 1. Spotify Clone
The Spotify clone is my best project in this repository. It is a static clone of the Spotify homepage created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clone features a functional music system, allowing users to play, pause, and switch tracks. This project showcases my ability to replicate complex designs and implement interactive features using web technologies.

**Features:**
- Responsive design
- Functional music player with play, pause, and track switching
- CSS animations and transitions
- JavaScript for interactive elements
